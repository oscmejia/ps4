Our homework is available in both a master branch, and a parallel debugging branch which 
contains all of our (extensive) debugging code. 

Impressions of working in a team:

Working in a team was an incredibly rewarding experience for us. We were really able to balance
out each other's strengths and make significant progress on the pset within days of starting it. 


Comments:

We got the pset pretty much completed by Saturday night. However, our debugging statements showed
that we were off when calculating the new QVar values for a triangle within the step function. 

Both of us went to all office hours (Wed, Thursday, Monday, and Tuesday) but the TFs were unable 
to help us figure it out. We also posted on Piazza but to no avail. 

After spending countless hours trying to figure out what the problem was we hit our max late hours 
and had to turn the pset in. 

We would just like to point out that this was not a case of last minute debugging. The past 3 days 
have been spent trying to figure out this one bug. We believe the rest of the code is implemented correctly
according to feedback received both in part A and from TFs throughout the process. 

So while our code does not produce the visualizations required, we believe it is because of this bug,
but that hopefully our feedback/evaluation on this pset will not be significantly hampered by it!
